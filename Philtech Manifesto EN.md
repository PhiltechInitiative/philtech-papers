# Philtech
_Technologies for tomorrow. Together_

We, the global open Philtech Initiative, are proclaiming a new era of philtech – technologically fueled, exponentially growing organizations that are focused on definitive solutions to problems that humankind is facing right now and in the near future. Philtech aims to eliminate the root causes of such problems, rather than simply treating the symptoms. **Philtech is becoming the *new norm* for organizations of tomorrow**, as society increasingly demands that enterprises focus on social impact and measure success by the contributions made to the common good.

## Why it matters today

The world is becoming an increasingly complex, complicated place to live – full of excitement, uncertainty, and despair all at the same time. The exponential growth of technology in the developed world makes people’s quality of life infinitely better. However, its universal adoption lags far behind. **An extremely uneven distribution of wealth and resources leads to a digitized utopia of unlimited goods for some and a continuous struggle for survival for the rest of the planet.** We are left with a stratified, institutionally outdated/obsolete society, more isolated, dehumanized, and full of doubt than ever.

## When old ways no longer work

It’s not an option to merely let progress lead wherever it leads us. **The image of tomorrow’s world largely depends on a focused, conscientious, collaborative effort by all of us.**

**Intergovernmental bodies**, which identified many of the global issues we’re facing today, are **not efficient enough** to find necessary solutions. They are too caught up in short-term political decisions and a never-ending cycle of approvals and ratifications.

**Transnational corporations** and **huge conglomerates** have driven the world economy for decades, but the **‘increase profits at any cost’ approach is no longer viable**. Their current attempts at social responsibility, even if sincere and consistent, are not even remotely sufficient to solve existing global issues.

Traditional **philanthropic organizations** and **charitable funds** are investing tremendous resources to reduce the harm that’s already been done, but **dedicate much less effort to address the root causes of the problems**. Often, they are disconnected from the latest technological development, and **lack the knowledge and tools required to measure and maximize their impact**.

## Moving toward global collaboration

In less than two decades, we’ve observed the rise of some truly innovative, transformative organizations. They’ve been applying technology not simply to advance and enhance existing capabilities but to reinvent solutions to global problems. Thanks to them, today we have access to unprecedented new ways to gain knowledge and effectively collaborate across the globe:
 
> **Wikipedia** (Jimmy Wales) — a free encyclopedia of everything co-authored by everyone

> **Creative Commons** (Lawrence Lessig, Ryan Merkley) — protecting intellectual property without restricting the open exchange of information

> **Khan Academy** (Salman Khan) — a free, world-class education for anyone, anywhere

> **GitHub** (Chris Wanstrath et. al.) — the world’s largest community of open source software developers

> **Sci-Hub** (Alexandra Elbakyan) — mass and public access to scientific knowledge and academic papers

> **OpenAI** (Elon Musk & Sam Altman) — free access to powerful artificial intelligence

> **Kickstarter** (Perry Chen) — bringing independent creative projects to life, powered by crowdfunding

> **OpenStreetMap** (Steve Coast) — a free editable map of the entire world

## Establishing Philtech Initiative

These above are just a few examples of projects and leaders that inspire us. We believe all of them share common traits that have allowed them to grow so rapidly and to have such an enormous impact. We attempted to study their features and qualities, and to thoroughly analyze and understand how these organizations and their participants work.

We strongly believe in these values and principles: dedication and loyalty to the idea, openness and mutual inclusivity, and equality of access. We want to formalize and refine our understanding, and turn it into shareable knowledge — a reproducible approach that can be applied to any public organization and community. This desire brought us together into an open and global Philtech Initiative.

## Our goals and aspirations

In order to bring this knowledge to the world and to inspire more organizations and collectives to positively impact our shared future, we are striving to:

- Outline the core principles of philtech – new approach to creating and managing sustainable and efficient global purpose-driven organizations
- Popularize and distribute these principles to make them common knowledge
- Define universally applicable philtech criteria
- Turn measurable and verifiable social impact into one of the cornerstones of any business plan, roadmap, and commercial proposal around the globe
- Create a global network of philtech communities to develop and grow new organizations, leaders, and visionaries
- Design methodologies, models, and tools for philtech organizations
- Organize a regular, traveling Philtech Hackathon in global cities around the world
Openly share our progress and all accumulated data under the CC-BY-SA license

## Philtech Criteria (α-version)

By adhering to these approaches and design principles, virtually any organization or community in the future will be able to stay consistently successful, profitable and prosperous while maximizing common good.

> **Massive Transformative Purpose** — the organization acts towards a durable and continuous quality of life improvements for the broadest audience possible. The beneficiary is all humankind.

> **Technological by design** — the organization creates reproducible methods and automated processes, and interacts with the outer world using standardized data and digital interfaces.

> **Measurability and verifiability** — the organization uses multiple metrics to track its progress toward its goals and to measure social impact. It systematically analyzes all of its activities and provides verifiable source data.

> **Scalability** — from the beginning, the organization is capable of exponential growth.

> **Sustainability and autonomy** — the organization is financially self-sufficient and independent from political decisions and central ruling authorities.

> **Openness and cooperativity** — the organization is built on trust and open collaboration, creating shared value for all participants.

## Join the mission

Everyone! Startups and commercial enterprises, aspiring entrepreneurs and seasoned tech gurus, data scientists and sociologists, thinkers and creators, philanthropic foundations and individual patrons. **The time to act is now. Only together we can gain enough traction to ensure persistent positive development of the world.**

We can usher in a future where **financial success is inseparable from social impact**, exponential growth of technology restores and nurtures the ecosystem, **society can sensibly and compassionately coexist, and every individual is able to reclaim their power, dignity, and responsibility**. Once a critical majority of organizations around the globe are naturally growing and functioning within these principles — **philtech mission will be complete**; our continuous efforts won’t be required any longer.
