# Principles and Criteria for Philtech Organizations

## Principles

- **work on causes, not symptoms** — philtech is a response to insufficient attention to solving techno-humanitarian and socioeconomic problems: it doesn't simply tackle their grave consequences;
- **combine advanced business practices with deep human values** — you no longer need to choose between making money and contributing to the common good: philtech demonstrates how to create profitable and globally scalable organizations in order to have a lasting impact on people's lives;
- **can make mistakes** — it is difficult to prevent making mistakes, but you can prevent repeating them; the radical transparency of philtech organizations allows you to maximize utilization of each other's experiences;
- **have a variety of solutions** — problems have many solutions; by encouraging the comparison of different methods, philtech contributes to identifying the best ideas, faster;
- **spread best practices** — any philtech solution, or organization even, can be freely replicated anywhere in the world, and interested community members support the launch of a new enterprises with knowledge, specialists, and resources;
- **champion voluntary, open interaction** — Philtech prefers open and honest interaction for mutual development, principles of self-organization and self-management, and building long-term relationships in the global market to violence of any form: from directly imposing one's will, to subtle manipulation and asymmetrical information access;
- **foster absolute inclusiveness** — anyone can contribute to the development of philtech organizations by: researching the nature of problems and their causes, proposing solutions and helping to find relevant experience, directly implementing problem-solving projects, disseminating information, and financing;
- **are self-demonstrated** — a Philtech Initiative must be identifiable as a philtech organization, in accordance to all philtech criteria.


## Criteria

We consider an organization a philtech organization when all criteria are in the green zone.

1. **[Massive Transformative Purpose]** — a long-term sustainable **improvement in the quality of life of all people** and humanity as a whole.
<span style="color:red">0  symptom relief</span>
<span style="color:red">1  one-time solution</span>
<span style="color:orange">2  regular/systematic problem solving</span>
<span style="color:green">3  significant reduction in causes</span>
<span style="color:green">4  eliminates causes and provides sustainable long-term improvements to quality of life</span>

2. **Scalability** — the capacity for [exponential growth](https://www.slideshare.net/vangeest/exponential-organizations-h).
<span style="color:red">0   we have an idea, and it’s even something that could work, but it's not a turn-key solution
<span style="color:red">1  manual or small-scale production of products</span>
<span style="color:orange">2  own production chain or centralized service</span>
<span style="color:orange">3  licensed technology, service network, or franchise</span>
<span style="color:green">4  openly reproducible technology/product, or a global service</span>
<span style="color:green">5 ⭐**️ common good** — the organization has built an infrastructure that allows anyone to easily use the product's valuable properties</span>

3. **Technological** (SAMR)(technological design) — its ability be described and automated, its ability to be embedded, or to integrate and connect with it using standardized data and compatible digital interfaces. Technological innovation is its ability to change the method of solving the problem itself and a person's capacity.
<span style="color:red">0  there is no technology, each new case is unique, and the result is unpredictable. There is no action plan.</span>
<span style="color:red">1  Substitution — technology acts as a direct replacement for a person’s actions, without making functional changes.</span>
<span style="color:orange">2  Augmentation — technology acts as a direct replacement tool for human action, and expands a person's functional capacity</span>
<span style="color:green">3  Modification — technology allows you to significantly change the way a problem is solved </span>
<span style="color:green">4  Redefinition — technology allows you to solve previously unsolvable tasks</span>

4. **Transparency, measurability, and verifiability** — you systematically analyze your results, describe measurement methods, and provide verifiable primary data. *This criterion is only met when a method for obtaining reliable information is provided.*
<span style="color:red">0  It isn't clear why it does it, how it does it, what it does, or who does it.</span>
<span style="color:red">1  The motives and goals of the organization have been outlined. What you need to measure is clear, but no methods exist to measure it.</span>
<span style="color:orange">2  Methods, tasks, action plans, roles and participants have been outlined; techniques for qualitatively measuring the result exist, and regular measurements are conducted.</span>
<span style="color:orange">3  We have open real-time data on operating activities (suppliers, customers, internal tasks), and we calculate the solutions contribution to humankind.</span>
<span style="color:green">4  open real results (with verifiable primary data available), the solution's [environmental and social] impact is quantitatively measured, and open findings (qualitative assessments of responsible parties) are available.</span>
<span style="color:green">5  All organizational structures and processes are described sufficiently for others to independently reproduce the organization.</span>

5. **Sustainability and autonomy** — the organization is financially self-sufficient and environmentally friendly, while being as independent as possible from political decisions.
<span style="color:red">0  The organization is dependent on other organizations, government programs, special economic conditions, private preferences or other administrative tools for financial, managerial support, or for other resources.</span>
<span style="color:orange">1  The organization needs occasional/partial financial support, or organizational and managerial assistance.</span>
<span style="color:orange">2  The organization provides for itself financially, managerially, and in terms of needed resources, but it doesn't have the means for substantial development and scaling.</span>
<span style="color:green">3  The organization has the resources to develop and management and growth freedom.</span>
<span style="color:green">4  ⭐️ The organization makes its partners, or the ecosystems it is a part of, more autonomous.</span>

6. **Openness and cooperativity, integrability and automatability** — the organization is based on trusting interaction and creating value for all employees, users, and partners. A horizontal organizational model and community. Public validation and control. Co-ownership and co-financing. Access, rent, and share instead of own.
<span style="color:red">0  The organization and its product cannot be automated to become an element of the ecosystem. Management is from top to bottom with a division of labor.</span>
<span style="color:red">1  The organization can be automated, but its founders aren't interested. Reproducible processes, stable regulated hierarchies.</span>
<span style="color:orange">2  The organization can be part of an ecosystem; an automated API can be created or exists in a limited form; and the founders generally share ideas. Innovation, meritocracy, and responsibility.</span>
<span style="color:green">3  An organization wants to be and can be part of an ecosystem; the founders are interested in interacting with other organizations and acting as an integral part of large organizations; there is a functional API for connecting with other organizations. Empowerment, value culture, and interest.</span>
<span style="color:green">4  The organization was originally designed to be an automated, infrastructural system. Self-organization, evolution oriented, and integrity.</span>
